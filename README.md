This assigment was meant to convert Activity 26 from using the ReactCOntext API to use the Redux store instead. Some notes about the Activity 26:

* The repo provided had a half implemented wishlist component. This had to expunged from the various parts of the code.

* The repo did not compile as downloaded, some minor syntax errors and variable renames had to be performed.

The conversion highlights are:

 * the global state is now provided through ```./src/utils/store.js``` instead of ```./src/utils/GlobalState.js```. The initial state and reducers are contained in that single file.
 
 * the React provider for redux is in ```./src/App.js```
